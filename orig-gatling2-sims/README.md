This directory contains some gatling2 simulations that we built before updating
the rest of the tools to be compatible with gatling2.  They should probably be
migrated up into the 'simulation-runner' directory.

You can use the shell script here to run sims directly from a gatling binary
distribution, rather than using our simulation-runner tool... if you want to :)
